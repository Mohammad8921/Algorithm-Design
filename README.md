This repository contains my algorithm design codes which are implemented in C++. I used some design approaches to solve the problems, such as Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, and Greedy Algorithms. The Problems need some concepts of algorithms to model them into the computer science world and solve them.
Bracket Factory -> Dynamic Programming, Strings
Chess -> Graph Theory, Greedy
Deadline -> Greedy
Dividing Puff -> basic gcd recursive algorithm 
Emergency planning -> Graph Theory, BFS
Royal co-worker -> Dynamic Programming (memoize)
Spatial Sorter -> Divide and Conquer
TAs sort -> Dynamic Programming
Transformation Puzzle -> Graph Theory, Shortest path
