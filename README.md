# Algorithm Design
This repository contains my algorithm design codes which are implemented in C++. I used the following design approaches to solve the problems: Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, and Greedy Algorithms. The Problems need some algorithmic concepts to model them into the computer science world and then solve them.
* Bracket Factory: Dynamic Programming, Strings
* Chess: Graph Theory, Greedy
* Deadline: Greedy
* Dividing Puff: Basic gcd recursive algorithm 
* Emergency planning: Graph Theory, BFS
* Royal co-worker: Dynamic Programming (memoize)
* Spatial Sorter: Divide and Conquer
* TAs sort: Dynamic Programming
* Transformation Puzzle: Graph theory, Shortest path
